# AutistikKnight
3D multiplayer Game based on unity with Arduino motion control capture

Module 1 - Character modeling, rigging, and motion in Autodesk Maya.
          step1: plug in your arduino and check on what port it's connected 'COMX'  X-> value from 1 to 7 then launch the sensor program
          step2: open the Maya scene, and run the script mayaServer.py
          step3: modify in your editor arduinoRead.py with the COMX (X from step1) and launch it in the python shell
          
          step4: Your Left_Arm_Controller in the Maya Scene will move on the X Y Z axis as the arduino sensor moves (sketchy at the moment)

Module 2 - Character Animation in MotionBuilder 

Module 3 - Character interaction and phisix in Unity3d
