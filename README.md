# AutistikKnight
3D multiplayer Game based on unity with Arduino motion control capture

1. Module 1 - Character modeling, rigging, and motion in Autodesk Maya.

         1. step1: plug in your arduino and check on what port it's connected 'COMX'  X-> value from 1 to 7 then launch the sensor program
         2. step2: open the Maya scene, and run the script mayaServer.py*
         3. step3: modify in your editor arduinoRead.py with the COMX (X from step1) and launch it in the python shell*
         4. step4: Your Left_Arm_Controller in the Maya Scene will move on the X Y Z axis as the arduino sensor moves (sketchy at the moment)*

2. Module 2 - Character Animation in MotionBuilder 

3. Module 3 - Character interaction and phisix in Unity3d
